        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Foundations of Medicine is a passion project developed between a few medical students from the University of Sydney.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project is to use open source and freely available software to demonstrate how simple technologies
            to demonstrate how medical education can be brought into the 21st century. As part of this project, we have formed 
            collaborations both with doctors, other like-minded students, and medical/clinical schools. <br>
            We aim to be a resource for medical students now and in the future, as well as providing open-source tools on our 
            Github repository to enable other medical schools and educational institutes to follow suit.
