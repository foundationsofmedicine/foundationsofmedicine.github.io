                    Ms Davies, 58 never married, no children </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Is a fiction writer by trade and used to live in Wentworth Falls, where it was peaceful and she could focus on her writing </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Moved into the Parramatta area after her diagnosis to be closer to medical care and facilities like shopping </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">History of presenting illness </div>
                
            
                
                    Around a year ago she presented to her old GP, complaining of bloating which was unrelieved by flatus or defecation, was unrelated to diet </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She also had lower abdominal/groin pain, and sometimes lower back pain </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She lost a little weight but attributed that to a lack of energy and appetite </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She had an ultrasound that showed a mass on her right ovary. Surgery was performed and she was diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer. She had a hysterectomy, with removal of the omentum </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She had chemotherapy with a taxol and cisplatin, which made her feel generally ill and fatigued, and made her fair fall out in climps, so she shaved it off and got a wig </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Radiotherapy hasn&#39;t been used so far, with her abdomino-=pelvic spread being deemed too hard to access. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has metastases within the pelvic cavity, the liver, her lumbosacral spine. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Today she is presenting because of worsening abdominal pain, which is no longer responding to codeine. The abdo pain is in the Right upper quadrant and is constant, non-radiating, and is better when she is still. She also has lower abdominal pains (1) A full crampy kind of pain in her middle and lower abdomien which is diffuse. She still passes flatus, which rarely helps. (2) Lower abdominal pain that is more sharp and irritated by movement </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She also has an unusual new pain in her upper outer thigh. It&#39;s a burning, shooting kind of pain that feels kind of like electriity. This pain doesn&#39;t respond to codeine or over the counter medications. She&#39;s had it for a few weeks now. Bending her hips can sometimes help. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She still has back pain that she treats with paraetamol and nurofen on bad days </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has taken for her pain: paracetamol, nurofen, panadeine forte, and &#39;another strong one that her doctor prescribed her once but it made her so nauseous she couldn&#39;t sit at her desk to write&#39; </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She is also having increasing urinary frequency, not associated with dysuria or polydipsia </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Past medical history </div>
                
            
                
                    No other ongoing medical illnesses </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No surgery apart from her cancer debulking </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No known allergies </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She is post-menopausal (55) and her menopause was uneventful, and she is not on HRT (nor has she ever been) </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She used the OCP for around 30 years on and off, and has never been pregnant </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Social history </div>
                
            
                
                    She smokes sometimes, when she&#39;s having periods of writers block because it helps her feel calmer and busier when she can&#39;t churn out any writing. Probably for a few months every few years - never regularly </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Her parents are not alive - They died in a train crash in the UK 5 years ago. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She is estranged from her sister after they fell out over a man when she was 33 - she has no idea where or how she is. This is makingly inrceasingly sad now that she knows she will die soon. She wants to mend the bridge but doesn&#39;t know how to find her sister </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She drinks 2-3 glasses of wine most days, and believes that her greatest joy is a well-sticked cellar. She finds with all the cancer treatment though she&#39;s lost her sense of taste. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She manages her ADLs for the most part, though she has taken to getting home delivery for dinner. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She gets depressed when she is too tired or nauseous to write, or walk along the river. Sometimes it bothers her that she really has noone to talk to about all the things that have been going on since she has had cancer. She sometimes regrets not having a family </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Family history </div>
                
            
                
                    She had an aunt who died of breast cancer at 63 </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No other remarkable family history, but doesn&#39;t know about her sister </br></br>
