                    You are 72 years old, live alone and have been a carpenter all your life </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Your wife left you for another woman, your daughter is currently in London upset about a current breakup with a boyfriend, and Your son is in a mental institute. (both of these are imaginary, but that is a whole separate OSCE) You do have a neighbor who is very helpful. She does the shopping, cooking, cleaning and collection of your pension. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    You actually got in a fight with her because you donâ€™t appreciate her and are worried that she won&#39;t help out as much anymore </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Officially retired since 66, You have been building small tables, chair sets, chest drawers and birdhouses for people and selling them. It has been a good gig, but since the arthritis has been acting up, you have not been able to pick up the tools or properly build anything. It is very limiting on your work. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Your only other form of income is the state old pension, which is crap. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    You have problem picking up the washing, cooking yourself dinner (not sure if that is related or due to the arthritis), cannot get out of the bath without assistance. Sometimes have to walk around the house with your shirt all unbuttoned. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Your rheumatoid was diagnosed when you were 60 when you couldn&#39;t understand why it was so hard to get out of bed in the morning, you have been on simple NSAIDs throughout that time and it seemed you could manage. There have been no other symptoms except your hands seem to deviate out. Currently, you are simply upset that you can&#39;t make a little chair for your imaginary grandchild, Chloe. </br></br>
