                    Julie was growing well, however it was hard work for Noelle to maintain feeds, as Julie often slept through the schedule feeding time, and Noelle didn&#39;t know whether to wake her up or not. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Over the last month or so, Noelle has let Julie miss feeds while she slept as it didn&#39;t seem to make any difference to the amount of milk Julie drank. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    One of Noelle&#39;s friend&#39;s pointed out that Julie seems smaller than the other babies the same age as Noelle&#39;s mother&#39;s group, and suggested that Noelle bring Julie to you (GP) </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No change in bowel habits - no diarrhoea </br></br>

                    The pregnancy was uncomplicated, with both baby and mother well throughout </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Julie does not have Down Syndrome </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Normal vaginal delivery at term, no complications </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Apgar scores 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 mins respectively </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Birth length and weight were 85th centile </br></br>

                    Breast feeding commenced soon after birth, but Julie had some trouble latching on, and had bottle feeds while Noelle waited for an appointment with a lactation consultant. After this, breastfeeding was resumed at 2 weeks and has continued until 1 month ago </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Noelle finds breast feeding hard and has replaced to use bottles of cow&#39;s milk and water instead. Sometimes, Noelle mixes the water with cordial. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Julie is a very sleepy baby and often falls asleep during feeding as weel as sleeping through feeding time </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Julie drinks 2-3 bottles per day </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The number of nappy changes has decreased from what it used to be - Noelle thought this was normal for a baby getting older </br></br>

                    Money is tight as her rent for her flat has gone up, so Noelle can&#39;t afford baby formula </br></br>
