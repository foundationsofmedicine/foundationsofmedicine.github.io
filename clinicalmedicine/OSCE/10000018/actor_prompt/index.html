                    6 month old Brian has diarrhoea for the past 2 days. During this time he has had 6 bowel moevments per day. The stools are runny and a greeny brown colour. No blood has been passed in the stool. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has not been vomiting and he doesn&#39;t have a fever. His temperature has been monitored every 4 hours at home (Axillary) </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Brian has been refusing his food and is drinking only a few sips of juice every 3 hours. Normally he drinks 160mLs of milk or half strength juice every 3 hours. He also has rice cereal and veggies 3 times a day </br></br>
                
            
                
                    His urine output is hard to determine due to diarrhoea but his mother thinks it is reduced as the nappies are not wet when he hasn&#39;t passed a motion. Brian has not had any tears when he has cried in the past 8 hours. He is rather sleepy and lethergic and is becoming harder to arouse. When he is awake he is cranky and irritable. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has not tried any new foods prior to the onset of diarrhoea. No one at home is ill. Brian has a 2 year old brother and 4 year old sister. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    There is no previous history of any illnesses and he is not taking any medications. His immunisations are current; although he requires his 6 month injectino. When weighed last week he weighed 7.5 kg. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has just been quite sleepy and irritable, crying a lot </br></br>
