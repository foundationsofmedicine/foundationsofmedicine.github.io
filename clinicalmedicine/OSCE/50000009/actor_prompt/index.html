                    Have had bad headaches since adolescence. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    First occurred at age 13 in the school playground after a game of hockey. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Headaches occur every 3-4 months. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Prodrome- warning signs include feeling hyper, edgy and nauseous as well as queasy in stomach. Hard to define how long it starts but roughly a few hours before headache. Comes on gradually during the day. Usually worsened by overdoing things and lack of sleep as well as finishing big projects at work. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Aura- stars usually appear in vision before headache arrives. These start in the middle of the visual field and come with nausea. The stars have a zig-zag streaky quality about them and last about 20 minutes. This only occurs occasionally.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Headache- follows the stars quite quickly. Mostly on the right side behind the eye. Very severe pain and comes with nausea. Usually vomit several times early in the attack and the pain can last from several hours to an entire day. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Resolution- need to lie down as soon as possible when headache hits. Movement and activity from yourself or others around you will exacerbate the symptoms and make you feel worse. You feel very sleepy and require 3 soluble aspirins to get relief and there is an urgent need to get to sleep to get rid of it. The presence of the aura requires immediate aspirin or else it ceases to have any effect on the headache. Will be better when you wake up. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Postdrome- for several days after the headache you feel very drained and not quite on top of things. </br></br>
