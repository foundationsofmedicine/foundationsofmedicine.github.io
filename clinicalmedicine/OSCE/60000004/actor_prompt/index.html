                    Mr. Con D’Angelo is a 32 year old male </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">History of presenting complaint </div>
                
            
                
                    Mr D’Angelo has a 12 week history of abdominal pain and diarrhoea. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The pain is located in the hypogastrium/suprapubic (pt can point to this area), it doesn’t radiate. It was gradual in onset and comes and goes. It is relieved somewhat with defecation and flatulence. He rates the pain as about a 6/10. He felt better for a couple of weeks when he stopped eating dairy and bread after his sister advised him to do this (she is very interested in nutrition and has had bowel problems herself). But it was too hard to maintain so he gradually started eating it again. There is nothing that makes the pain worse that he has noticed. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The stool is pale in colour. It also has quite an offensive odour. He has been frequenting the toilet about 5 times a day, with runny stool. There has been a small amount of blood on some occasions, but never any black stools. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Associated symptoms </div>
                
            
                
                    He has also been experiencing some abdominal distension and bloating. He has also been feeling quite tired lately but put that down to a busy lifestyle and lack of sleep. He has lost a couple of kilos he thinks.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Past medical history </div>
                
            
                
                    He has had this before quite often as a child growing up in an Italian family, they ate a lot of pasta. But it stopped when he moved out of home at 18 and started cooking for himself (steak and veges).  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He had his appendix removed at 11, and no other hospitalisations.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Medications and allergies </div>
                
            
                
                    He takes Panadol occasionally for headaches but is on no other medications.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has no allergies. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Social history </div>
                
            
                
                    He has recently gotten married and lives with his wife in Leichhardt. His wife has 2 children, girls aged 5 and 7 from a previous relationship. He is a fireman. He was born in Australia though his parents migrated here when they were in their 20s from italy.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He drinks a glass of red wine with dinner at night (when he is not on duty) and a few more at family social occasions.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has never smoked.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has had no overseas travel recently.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Family history </div>
                
            
                
                    Both his parents are alive and well.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    There is a FHx of type 1 diabetes his sister and brother. There is no history of inflammatory bowel disease in the family </br></br>
                
            
                
                    His sister has had similar problems that are now relieved with a dairy and wheat free diet, though she was never diagnosed with anything. (He does heard about coeliac disease and wonders if this could be the cause of his problem?)  </br></br>
