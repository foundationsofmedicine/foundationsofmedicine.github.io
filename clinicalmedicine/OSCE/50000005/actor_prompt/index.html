                    You will need to play the part of two people for this task: Anika Smith who is a 17-year-old female who has just had a seizure, and her mother Sharon Smith who was the main witness.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Anika </div>
                
            
                
                    Felt unusual all of a sudden while dancing with her cousins and then blacked out. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She can’t remember much after that. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Has a bad headache, a sore tongue, and her muscles feel very tired and weak. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She had eaten and had plenty to drink prior to the blackout. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Sharon </div>
                
            
                
                    Was watching her daughter dancing in the black and white flashing strobe light. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She all of a sudden stopped and went stiff and then fell hard to the floor. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Her whole body started jerking for over a minute and she couldn’t be woken. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She wet her pants during the attack and was very disorientated when she was waking up. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She believes that her daughter is not yet back to her usual self. </br></br>
