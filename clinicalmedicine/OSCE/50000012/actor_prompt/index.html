                    My daughter wanted me to come to have my memory tested but I don’t think there is anything wrong. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I don’t have any trouble remembering things. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I don&#39;t have any other issues (eg weakness, dizziness, gait problems, incontinence). </br></br>

                    I live at home with my two cats. My husband died 10 years ago. I play bingo every Tuesday, I teach reading at the community centre, I visit the sick at the hospital on Sundays and I play bridge with my friends. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I think my life is rich and fulfilling. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Don’t use alcohol or cigarettes. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I did take the wrong bus a few times, my house is a bit of a mess, I let my neighbour shop for me, my phone was disconnected once because I forgot to pay the bill. The stove caught fire once. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    My daughter is always there fore me and I have supportive friends. </br></br>
