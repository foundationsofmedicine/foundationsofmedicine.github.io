                    Mrs. Sally, 42 y/o female living with her husband Mike, 48 y/o </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No nearby factories or business (other than cafes and retail outlets) to her residence </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Husband has retail business and he builds residential homes in the vicinity of Glebe </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally has no children </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally has smoked 25 cigarettes a day since she was 15 years old </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally drinks two glasses of wine a night and perhaps more on weekends </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally has held down several jobs over the years </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally is currently a secretary in her husband’s building business, operated out of premises in Auburn. She has worked here for 5 years </br></br>
                
            
                
                    There are many nearby factories and businesses, but none that seem to release a lot of smoke or pollution </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Prior to this, Sally has been working for Blake Dawson Waldron as a legal secretary for 3 years </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Blake Dawson Waldron is located in the city </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She found the job too stressful, and quit to work with her husband </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally left school at 15 years and got a job as an administrative assistant for Sheraton (in the city)  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has worked in this position for about 10 years and they then had her trained as a receptionist  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She worked as a receptionist for another 9 years but was made redundant during a corporate restructure in 1995 </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally’s mother died (of breast cancer) when Sally was 15 and she lived at home with her father until she was 25 </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The family had lived in Marrickville in a family home - there were no nearby factories </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Her father was a ship builder </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He was contracted by the Navy to build ships while Sally lived at home. After her mother’s death, she had washed all of his clothes, including his work clothes. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally&#39;s hobbies were mainly socialising with friends on the weekend. She occasionally went to the beach and has a pet cat. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Sally has no brothers or sisters. Her father had passed away 5 years previously from breast cancer. He had also been a smoker.  </br></br>
