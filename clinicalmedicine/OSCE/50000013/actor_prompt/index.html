                    Sally Garner is a 25-year-old woman who presents to her GP with fatigue. Her boss has suggested she might be depressed. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">History of Presenting Complaint </div>
                
            
                
                    Been feeling stressed and fatigued over the past few months, especially since she went back to work part-time (1 month ago) after the birth of her first child 7 months ago. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Over the past few months she has been feeling teary, but she thinks this is from sleep deprivation with the new baby. She gets 5 hours of broken sleep, woken 3 times a night. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She wakes up early in the mornings even before the baby and is continually worried about her job. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She works as a research officer in a pathology laboratory. At work, she is finding it hard to concentrate, and is falling behind. When her boss pulled her up, she burst into tears despite them usually having a good relationship. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Her weight has returned to normal since the birth of her child, but over the past months she has lost 5kg. She has lost her appetite and her husband is worried about her. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has stopped going to her mothers’ group recently because she ‘would rather be by herself.’ She finds it hard to interact because ‘everyone else is just so cheery.’ She doesn’t want to look like she isn’t coping. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has recently been thinking about just ending it all, perhaps by gassing herself in her car. She lies awake in the mornings thinking about this as an option rather than facing the day. She appreciates what this would do to her husband and child. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Past Medical History </div>
                
            
                
                    She is otherwise healthy; the pregnancy was uneventful and the delivery was normal. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Medications </div>
                
            
                
                    She is not on any medications. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Social History </div>
                
            
                
                    She is married and her husband works full-time as a sales manager. He is very supportive. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Her mother now takes care of the baby while she is at work but she is afraid of being a burden on her mother. She worries continually while at work. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has been having a glass of wine or two when she gets back from work to calm her nerves and they usually finish the bottle at dinner. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Family History </div>
                
            
                
                    Her parents are both alive. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Her father was an alcoholic but is now being treated with some kind of medication. </br></br>
