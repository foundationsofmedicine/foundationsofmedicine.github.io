                    Angela Knightly, Age 32 years with son Daniel 18 months </br></br>
                
            
                
                    You have brought in Daniel as he has had diarrhoea and vomiting for 2 days and are worried as you noticied blood in his nappy yesterday </br></br>
                
            
                
                    His stools are loose and brown with some blood present. You don&#39;t think you noticed pus or mucus but can&#39;t be sure. He has needed about 8 nappies a day and he normally does 1 or 2 small poos. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    You haven&#39;t been able to tell how much urine is in the nappies because of the diarrhoea </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He vomited 3 times on the first day but not at all yesterday </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He hasn&#39;t been really sweaty but has felt a bit hot - you do not have a thermometer at home to measure his temperature </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has just been quite sleepy and irritable, crying a lot </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has not been hungry at all and wouldn&#39;t even eat a banana (his favourite food) on the first day after he vomited. He did have some juice mixed with water and a few Saos. He normally eats basically what the rest of the family does and has always been a good earer (breast fed til 6 months). </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Nobody at home has been sick but he goes to child care one day a week and might have picked it up there. His father has ulcerative colitis and you wonder whether Daniel may have that too. He has not taken any antibiotics recently. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Past medical history </div>
                
            
                
                    He has never had diarrhoea for this long before although he did have an episode of about 24 hours 6 months ago. He only recently started day care. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has had quite a few colds and had a bad cough in winter and needed antibiotics then but he got better quite quickly and has been well up until now. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has not been in hospital since birth. He was born vaginally 1 week early and there were no problems for you ro Daniel with the delivery. You visit the early childhood center regularly and he has always been an appropriate height and weight. He has been developing normally and the nurse said he was going well. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has had all the scheduled vaccinations. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He has no allergies. </br></br>
