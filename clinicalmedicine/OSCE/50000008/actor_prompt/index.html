                    My husband wanted me to see a doctor because I’ve been getting more headaches and it has been making it difficult for me to take care of the children at times. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I’ve suffered from headaches since I was a teenager. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The first one occurred when I was about 18 years old. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I went to the doctor when I was 20 years old and he told me that I suffered from migraines. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Normally I would get about 4 migraines a year but over the last 3-4 months I’ve had a migraine every 2 weeks. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    When a migraine begins, the first thing that happens is that I get a spreading front of tingling followed by numbness. This lasts 20-30 minutes and moves from one part of the body to another. For instance, it may move from my hand to my face. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    There is no weakness. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No muscle twitching. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Following the numbness, I get a throbbing, pounding, painful headache that normally lasts for 6-8 hours. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The headache is usually on one side of my head. Hard to say exactly where. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The pain is only in my head and not anywhere else. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    When I get the headache, I get really sensitive to light and have to squint in daylight. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I normally get really badly nauseous and usually vomit at some point during the headache. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I feel better if I lie in a darkened room and try to sleep until the headache is gone. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I&#39;ve never taken any medication while I’m having the migraine. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    A doctor once put me on a dry called pizotifen to help stop me getting migraines but it made me put on heaps of weight so I stopped taking it. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Chocolate and red wine seem to make me get more migraines so I don’t eat chocolate or drink red wine anymore. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Strangely, I seemed to get less migraines when I was pregnant with my children. </br></br>

                    I&#39;ve only ever been in hospital to give birth to my children: 3 vaginal, 1 caesarean. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No high blood pressure. </br></br>

                    Aspirin when I get a migraine. </br></br>

                    I don’t smoke. I used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day from when I was about 16 years old to when I was 24. I stopped when I became pregnant with my first child </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I don&#39;t drink anymore just in case it causes a migraine. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    I have four children aged 3, 4, 9 and 11. </br></br>

                    Both parents are still alive. Dad has high blood pressure and mum is well other than some arthritis in her knees. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    My sister (32) suffers from migraines as well. </br></br>
