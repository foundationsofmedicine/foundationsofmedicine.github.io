                    You are David Jones, a 55 year old man </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">History of Presenting complaint </div>
                
            
                
                    Pain usually in the right flank. You also have pain at the right hypochondrium, up and under the ribs, sometimes in the back too. On specific questioning, you realise that the pain is always associated with abdominal pain and moves from your abdomen to the back (radiating). The pain is intermittent and you feel it every now and then </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The pain first occurred 6 months ago and recurred once every couple of months, has been worsening and becoming more regular over past two months.  </br></br>
                
            
                
                    It is worse with stress and when you eat fatty foods. The pain prevents you from sleeping when present and is a 7/10 on the pain scale. Minimal improvement with panadol. You don&#39;t take codeine as it makes you constipated </br></br>
