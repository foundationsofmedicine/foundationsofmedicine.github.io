                    Mr Michael Fox is a 63-year-old male who has come to see you, his new GP, for assessment of his condition. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He was diagnosed with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease at the age of 56. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    As you have not seen Mr Fox before, you will need to ask him about his diagnosis as well as ascertain his current symptom control. </br></br>
