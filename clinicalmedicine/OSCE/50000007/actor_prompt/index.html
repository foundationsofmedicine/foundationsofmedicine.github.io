                    19-year-old university student studying science. Likes uni but has been very stressed in the last few days about impending exams. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She was standing in line with her boyfriend (stuffy hall, waiting over 30 mins) waiting to have her student card renewed when she started to feel funny and passed out. She doesn’t think it was a big deal and is a bit embarrassed about it. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Before the attack she felt dizzy, lightheaded and sweaty. She also noted her vision dimming and she began to notice pins and needles. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She was not incontinent during the collapse, nor did she bite her tongue. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    When she woke up, she felt nauseated and confused only for a few seconds. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She feels fine at the moment, although felt a little lightheaded walking from her boyfriend’s car to the hospital. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Matt </div>
                
            
                
                    Was waiting in line with Hand, noticed she started to look pale and unwell and seemed to be “not with it.” </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He is concerned because she slumped limp to the ground, and he noticed her left leg twitch for a few seconds- he is worried she may have had an epileptic fit. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    He estimates that she was “out of it” for about 20 seconds, after which she was able to sit up. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Past Medical History </div>
                
            
                
                    Jane has never had an episode of loss of consciousness before, although she does remember feeling dizzy, faint and needing to sit down on a few occasions in the last few years- especially after standing up in a hurry. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She is recovering from a bout of gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhoea) that lasted 3 days, and began to resolve yesterday. She did not feel able to eat or drink much whilst she was sick and hasn’t had much to drink since she recovered- one glass of orange juice over breakfast and a coffee at uni. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She has no history of seizures, neurological problems or any other significant medical history. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    No medications or allergies. </br></br>
