                    Jane Allen has been brought to the Emergency Department by her concerned boyfriend, who reports that she was dizzy and ‘blacked out’ at university. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Please take a history of the presenting complaint from Jane and her boyfriend Matt, and summarise both your findings and the likely diagnosis to the examiner at the end. </br></br>
