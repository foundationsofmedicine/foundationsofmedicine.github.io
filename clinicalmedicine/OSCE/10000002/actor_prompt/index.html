                    Mrs Johnson, 52 years old, Female </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Caucasian descent </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Presenting </div>
                
            
                
                    Joint pain started 6 months ago </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Well, started &#39;noticing&#39; the pain 6 months ago, but now it&#39;s clearly present and painful </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Haven&#39;t had a fever recently, though fatigue associated with just the pain of moving your hands </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Some recent weight loss, but has only happened because you&#39;ve been dieting </br></br>
                
            
                
                    <div class = "history-component">Joint patterns </div>
                
            
                
                    Affects fingers on both sides (symmetrical) </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The joints are the knuckles mainly, but your knees are beginning to hurt </br></br>
                
            
                
                    You feel these joints are swelling, painful and warm </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Have been taking ibuprofen to reduce the pain. Have recently started a gel, but it doesn&#39;t completely get rid of the pain. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    The joints feel like they&#39;re glued together in the morning when you wake up, but get better over the day. It is worse in the first 30 minutes of waking. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Nothing else noticed, but maybe a bump on your elbows </br></br>

                    Your father had OSTEOarthritis. </br></br>

                    You&#39;ve recently cut yourself (shallow cut) when cutting vegetables, but it is fine. </br></br>
