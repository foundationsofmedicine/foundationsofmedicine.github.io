She has also noticed that sometimes her heart is beating &#39;funny&#39; and harder than normal, and has once or twice felt quite faint for no reason (i.e. not hungry, or just stood up). </br></br>

                    Didn&#39;t eat meat for a while, she&#39;s still a student so meat is expensive. But knows that red meat is important for iron, so has been trying to keep up meat intake. Still only has red meat around 1-2 times per month </br></br>
