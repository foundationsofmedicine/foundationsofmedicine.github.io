                    Ms Jones now presents with increasing headaches. They have been occurring since early twenties and is only now getting them checked out because they are getting worse, and they are stopping her from doing things such as exercising, work, eating certain foods such as wine, cheese and chocolate. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    She started the OCP in her early twenties. She also fell down a flight of stairs and fell other head, and thinks the headaches may be related to that. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Usual sequence of headache: visual scotoma/scintillations sometimes with blindness in the right eye (15-20 mins), throbbing headache over her left eye (2-6 hours), concurrent nausea and vomiting. Often feels a little bit dazed and hungry for several hours beforehand, which warns her that an attack is about to come on. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Frequency: around once a month, after her menstrual period. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Severity: 8/10. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Relief: sleep, and also some relief from drawing the blinds to cut out light. </br></br>
                
            
                
                    Current attempts at treatment: paracetamol, ibuprofen. </br></br>
