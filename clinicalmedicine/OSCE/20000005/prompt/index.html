                    A 65 year old woman, Mrs. Edna West, is concerned about her hearing and has made an appointment to see you. Lately, she finds herself asking her husband to repeat himself because she does not hear him well the first time he says things. Two days ago, she went to the movies and has trouble hearing the dialogue . She wishes you to evaluate her. Her vital signs are normal. </br></br>
