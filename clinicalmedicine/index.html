        <p>OSCE resources and banks play a major role in the improvement and self-assessment of clinical skills. Whilst these should in no way replace patient contact, they may be used to improve confidence when interacting with patients on the wards.
            Whilst the marking criteria for these resources may not reflect the examinations provided by your clinical school, we believe they offer some guidance regarding important components of an OSCE examination. <br>
            The OSCE bank is provided with no guarantees. If you wish to contribute, please email us at OSCE+medicine.foundations@gmail.com <br>
